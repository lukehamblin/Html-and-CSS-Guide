      <p style="text-align: center;">Understanding CSS Flexbox Layout and Its Properties</p>
      <p>The CSS Flexible Box Layout, commonly known as Flexbox, is a powerful layout model designed to simplify the structure and alignment of elements within a container. Flexbox operates along two axes: the main axis and the cross axis. By default, items within a flex container are laid out along the main axis in a single line, either horizontally (row) or vertically (column). Flexbox introduces properties such as <b>display: flex</b> on the container, which turns it into a flex container, and <b>flex-direction</b>, which determines the main axis direction, influencing how child elements flow within the container.</p>
      <p><b>Flex Container Properties:</b> The <b>justify-content</b> property controls the alignment of items along the main axis, allowing for distribution of space between, around, or even inside items. <b>align-items</b> aligns items along the cross axis within the flex container, affecting their positioning vertically in a row layout or horizontally in a column layout. Additionally, <b>flex-wrap</b> dictates whether items should wrap onto multiple lines if they exceed the container's width or height.</p>
      <p><b>Flex Item Properties:</b> Each item within a flex container can be individually sized and aligned using properties like <b>flex-grow</b>, <b>flex-shrink</b>, and <b>flex-basis</b>. These properties allow items to grow, shrink, or have a specific base size relative to the other items in the container, providing fine-grained control over their layout behavior.</p>
      <p><b>Responsive Design with Flexbox:</b> Flexbox's versatility extends to creating responsive designs effortlessly. By combining media queries with flex properties, developers can adjust the layout of their content based on screen size or device orientation, ensuring a seamless user experience across different devices and viewports.</p>
      <p><b>Browser Compatibility:</b> Most modern browsers support the CSS Flexbox module, making it a reliable choice for layout design in contemporary web development. However, it's essential to consider fallbacks or alternative layouts for older browser versions that may not fully support all Flexbox features.</p>
      <p><b>Conclusion:</b> Mastering CSS Flexbox empowers developers to create sophisticated and responsive layouts with ease. By leveraging its intuitive properties and flexible design approach, developers can streamline the development process and enhance the usability of web applications across various platforms and devices.</p>
